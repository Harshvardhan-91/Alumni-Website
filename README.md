ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=securePassword123
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com

# Cloudinary Configuration for Image Upload
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Client URLs for CORS
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Create `.env` file in server directory with the above variables
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd server
   npm install
   
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```
3. Setup MongoDB Atlas or local MongoDB database
4. Configure Cloudinary account and add credentials to `.env`
5. Start the server:
